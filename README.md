# News-Line Version 1.0
News Line is an app that pulls the latest articles from the latest new sites for users to save and review. Users can post comments about articles they have saved for others to see.

## Tech Used

Some of the tech I used to create this project.
* MongoDB   - Database
* NodeJS    - Server-Side Code
* EJS       - HTML Templating
* Express   - Server Routing and Managment
* Mongoose  - MongoDB ORM
* Cheerio   - Site Scraping
* Passport  - User Auth and Login

## Dashboard

After a user signs up and logs in they will be directed to the dashboard page. As people use the app they can select which news source they want to populate the list of articles with in the main window. From there each user can save and remove articles for themselves to view later or simple click on an article link to view it. They can also navigate to the Saved Article Page to manage their saved articles further.

## Saved Article

Saved Article lets users post comments and notes about what they have read to share with other users on the site or to keep for themselves. Each user is free to see comments from other users but only the owner of that note can actually edit or delete it.
